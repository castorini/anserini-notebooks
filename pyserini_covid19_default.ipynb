We generated an nsp1 mutant (nsp1-mt) that neither promoted host mRNA degradation nor suppressed host protein synthesis in expressing cells. Both a SARS-CoV mutant virus, encoding the nsp1-mt protein (SARS-CoV-mt), and a wild-type virus (SARS-CoV-WT) replicated efficiently and exhibited similar one-step growth kinetics in susceptible cells. Both viruses accumulated similar amounts of virus-specific mRNAs and nsp1 protein in infected cells, whereas the amounts of endogenous host mRNAs were clearly higher in SARS-CoV-mt-infected cells than in SARS-CoV-WT-infected cells, in both the presence and absence of actinomycin D. Further, SARS-CoV-WT replication strongly inhibited host protein synthesis, whereas host protein synthesis inhibition in SARS-CoV-mt-infected cells was not as efficient as in SARS-CoV-WT-infected cells. These data revealed that nsp1 indeed promoted host mRNA degradation and contributed to host protein translation inhibition in infected cells. Notably, SARS-CoV-mt infection, but not SARS-CoV-WT infection, induced high levels of beta interferon (IFN) mRNA accumulation and high titers of type I IFN production. These data demonstrated that SARS-CoV nsp1 suppressed host innate immune functions, including type I IFN expression, in infected cells and suggested that SARS-CoV nsp1 most probably plays a critical role in SARS-CoV virulence.\",\n",

RVFV is classified as a category A priority pathogen and a select agent in the U.S., and currently there are no therapeutics available for RVF patients. NSs protein, a major virulence factor of RVFV, inhibits host transcription including interferon (IFN)-b mRNA synthesis and promotes degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). NSs self-associates at the C-terminus 17 aa., while NSs at aa.210-230 binds to Sin3A-associated protein (SAP30) to inhibit the activation of IFN-b promoter. Thus, we hypothesize that NSs function(s) can be abolished by truncation of specific domains, and co-expression of nonfunctional NSs with intact NSs will result in the attenuation of NSs function by dominant-negative effect. Unexpectedly, we found that RVFV NSs truncated at aa. 6-30, 31-55, 56-80, 81-105, 106-130, 131-155, 156-180, 181-205, 206-230, 231-248 or 249-265 lack functions of IFN-b mRNA synthesis inhibition and degradation of PKR. Truncated NSs were less stable in infected cells, while nuclear localization was inhibited in NSs lacking either of aa. 81-105, 106-130, 131-155, 156-180, 181-205, 206-230 or 231-248. Furthermore, none of truncated NSs had exhibited significant dominantnegative functions for NSs-mediated IFN-b suppression or PKR degradation upon co-expression in cells infected with RVFV. We also found that any of truncated NSs except for intact NSs does not interact with RVFV NSs even in the presence of intact C-terminus self-association domain. Our results suggest that conformational integrity of NSs is important for the stability, cellular localization and biological functions of RVFV NSs, and the co-expression of truncated NSs does not exhibit dominant-negative phenotype.\",\n",

RVF is characterized by an acute febrile illness, hemorrhagic fever, neurological disorder or blindness in humans [1, 2, 3, 4] . In ruminants, RVFV induces a high rate of abortion or fetal malformation as well as lethal hepatitis in newborn lambs [5] . The first recognized outbreak of RVF occurred in Kenya in 1930 [6] , and RVFV has spread from endemic region in sub-Saharan Africa into Egypt [7] , Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] . The potential threat of RVFV introduction into non-endemic countries raises concern of agriculture and public health [13, 14, 15] . RVFV is a risk group 3 pathogen, Category A pathogen and an overlap select agent by the CDC/USDA [16] . The handling of wild-type (wt) RVFV within the U.S. requires BSL3+ or BSL4 facilities. Live-attenuated MP-12 vaccine strain is excluded from select agent rule, and handled at BSL2 level. MP-12 encodes for functional NSs protein, which is useful for the analyses of various NSs functions at BSL2 level [17, 18, 19] .\",\n",

NSs is a major virulence factor of RVFV and inhibits host general transcription through sequestration of TFIIH p44 [24] or promotion of TFIIH p62 subunits degradation [19] . NSs also inhibits host antiviral response by inhibiting the activation of interferon (IFN)-b promoter through interaction with Sin3A-associated protein (SAP30) at aa.210-230 [25, 26] , and promotion of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) degradation [17, 27, 28] .\",\n",

A number of candidate vaccines are under development including live-attenuated vaccine [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40] , formalin-inactivated vaccine [41, 42] , subunit vaccine [43] , virus-like particle [44, 45, 46, 47] , nonspreading RVFV replicon [48, 49] , viral vectors [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56] , and DNA vaccines [57, 58, 59] . For treatment of ongoing outbreaks, several antivirals have been tested for RVFV infection. Liposome-encapsulated ribavirin is effective to treat RVFV infection in mice [60] , while a potent IFN inducer, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid stabilized with poly-L-Lysine and carboxymethyl cellulose [Poly(LCIC)] are effective in combination with ribavirin [61] . Therapeutic administration of IFN-a into rhesus monkeys infected with RVFV also limits RVFV replication [62] . The 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide (T-705) is shown to be more effective to inhibit RVFV replication than ribavirin [63] , while antiviral small molecule, LJ001 was shown to be effective to numerous enveloped viruses including RVFV [64] . These studies suggest that increased innate immune responses could inhibit RVFV replication in addition to antivirals specific to viral proteins.\",\n",

It has been shown that recombinant MP-12 virus encoding truncated NSs at aa.210 to 230 (SAP30-binding domain) does not inhibit IFN-b mRNA synthesis [26] . Thus, we employed a similar strategy to abolish a part of NSs functions by truncating each 17 to 25 aa. Co-expression of such truncated NSs may exhibit dominant-negative phenotype by self-association through the Cterminus at the self-association domain (aa.249 to 265) [65] .

We tested ISG56 gene, one of the genes controlled under IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE), to confirm the inhibition of host transcription suppression including IFN-b mRNA by NSs. As expected, cells infected with MP-12 inhibited the synthesis of IFNb and ISG56 mRNA, while those infected with rMP12-C13type induced both IFN-b and ISG56 mRNA (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, none of NSs mutants, including NSD210-230 lacking SAP30binding domain, had inhibited IFN-b mRNA synthesis.

After 6 hours, newly synthesized host and viral proteins were labeled with [ 35 S] methionine/cysteine for 4 hours. Whole cell lysates were mixed with Strep-Tactin beads, and SF-tagged MP-12 NSs and bound host and viral proteins were precipitated. Presence of NSs bands were visualized with autoradiography ( Fig. 6 ). As expected, MP-12 NSs was co-precipitated with NSs-SF, and MP-12 NSs was migrating slightly faster than that of NSs-SF. The expression of truncated NSs was lower than that of MP-12 NSs (see input), while the expression of NSsD206-230 was not detectable. The same phenomenon was observed in a repeated experiment, suggesting the instability of NSsD206-230 expression in this experiment. On the other hand, we could not detect co-precipitation of any truncated NSs with NSs-SF. Collectively, our results suggest that those truncated NSs accumulates in cells at low level, mislocalizes, and do not interrupt the MP-12 NSs functions by co-expression.\",\n",

We substituted two sequential acidic amino acids triplets located at the C-terminus with alanines as shown in Fig. 7A; i.e., NSs-E253-255A/D257-259A, NSsD257-259A or NSs-E253-255A.

On the other hand, NSs-E253-255A/D257-259A or NSsD257-259A did not accumulate in cells efficiently, and the NSs could not be detected with IFA (data not shown). We then tested PKR degradation function and IFN-b mRNA suppression function of those mutants using VeroE6 cells and A549 cells using the same method as described above. Cells infected with NSs-E253-255A degraded PKR (Fig. 7B) , and inhibited the synthesis of IFN-b mRNA (Fig. 7C) , while those infected with NSs-E253-255A/ D257-259A or NSsD257-259A did not degrade PKR and did not inhibit IFN-b mRNA synthesis. The results suggest that the glutamic acid at aa.253 to 255 can be replaced without affecting [26] and C-terminus selfassociation domain (aa.249-265) [65] . The rMP12-C13type (C13type) encodes an in-frame truncation of aa. 16-198, NSs functions, while aspartic acid at aa.257 to 259 is important for NSs stability.\",\n",

Culture supernatants were harvested at 72 hpi for viral titration using plaque assay. RVFV titer was significantly decreased by the CAT RNA transfection when compared to mock-transfection control. Transfection with RNA encoding NSD249-265 did not further decrease RVFV titer compared to CAT RNA transfected control, while RNA encoding NSs-E253-255A increased RVFV titer significantly. These results suggest that co-expression of NSD249-265 NSs does not significantly decrease viral replication, while that of NSs-E253-255A facilitates RVFV replication by inhibiting IFN-b and PKR in transfected cells. Overall, co-expression of truncated NSs inhibited neither NSs functions nor RVFV replication efficiently. Even though NSs encode self-association domain at the Cterminus domain, the expressed protein mislocalizes in cells, and does not maintain the stability of intact NSs, which minimizes the dominant-negative effect on MP-12 NSs. Discussion Dominant-negative suppression of viral replication has been characterized in a number of different viral proteins [68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73] . For RVFV, L proteins form oligomer, and exhibit dominant-negative function [74] . In this study, we used NSs protein as a target protein of dominant-negative suppression, because a lack of NSs dramatically attenuates RVFV [75, 76] .\",\n",

However, our results were not as expected; 1) most of truncated NSs localized at cytoplasm, 2) all of truncated NSs did Our results suggest truncation of NSs causes mis-folding and/or mis-localization of protein, which might abolish the ability to interact with authentic MP-12 NSs through the C-terminus selfassociation domain. Unexpectedly, only the co-expression of NSs lacking C-terminus self-association domain (NSD249-265) slightly inhibited PKR degradation by MP-12 NSs. The NSD249-265 could accumulate both in cytoplasm and nucleus, which is consistent with previous study [65] . We speculate that NSD249-265 could compete with host factors required for PKR degradation with intact NSs. In the meantime, co-expression of NSD249-265 NSs did not result in a significant decrease of RVFV replication when compared to CAT RNA transfection control. Therefore, the co-expression of NSs fragments in infected cells might not be an effective strategy to inhibit RVFV replication in vivo.\",\n",

This suggests that conformation structure might be important for those NSs functions rather than the presence of linear domain. Our results suggest that those truncated NSs decrease accumulation level, and change the localization pattern in cells. The stability and cellular localization of NSs, which are probably controlled by conformational domain, might be important for biological functions of NSs. Although the C-terminus 17 amino acids were determined as a self-association domain important for filament formation [65] , our result suggests that filament formation does not occur by NSs encoding an in-frame truncation with 25 amino acids. It is possible that the C-terminus 17 amino acids are the prerequisite of NSs self-association, and other structural domains play a role in the filament formation through the C-terminus domain.\",\n",

It was also shown that NSs binding to SAP30 is required for NSs filaments to target pericentromeric DNA and induce nuclear anomalies [78] . They described that rec-ZHD210-230 expresses a stable NSs protein located in the nucleus in the discussion [78] . Thus, it might be possible that NSs encoding 20 aa. does not change the nuclear localization. On the other hand, NSD6-30, NSD31-55, NSD56-80 and NSD249-265, all of which encode SAP30-binding domain at aa.210-130, could be accumulated in nucleus, whereas they did not inhibit IFN-b gene, suggesting that NSs has another structural requirement to inhibit IFN-b gene activation in addition to SAP30 binding.
